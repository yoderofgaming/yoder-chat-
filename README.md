### 2. Configure and launch your environment
You'll need to specify four environment variables in order to get your bot up and running:
- `TOKEN` - Bot Token from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- `GUILD_CHAT_CHANNEL` - The ID of the channel where the bot should send and receive guild chat messages (e.g `792771296445726740`)
- `MINECRAFT_EMAIL` - The email of the Minecraft account you want the bot to use
- `MINECRAFT_PASSWORD` - The password of the Minecraft account you want the bot to use

**NOTE**: You can't use a Microsoft account for the bot.

### 3. Set prefix and emojis
You can edit the `constants.py` file to change the bot's prefix, and the emojis it uses.
```python
# The prefix the bot responds to for commands
PREFIX = '!'
# Emojis the bot should use for certain events
EMOJIS = {
    'DISCORD': 'üó®Ô∏è',  # When a message is sent from Discord
    'HYPIXEL': 'üéÆ',  # When a message is sent from Hypixel
    'JOIN': 'üì•',  # When a member joins Hypixel
    'LEAVE': 'üì§'  # When a member leaves Hypixel
}
# List of Owner IDs (to use commands like sumo)
OWNER_IDS = [177750582818242561]
```
You can use a unicode, like üéÆ, or custom emojis like `<:hypixel:855419679597920257>`
